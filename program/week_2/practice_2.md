# Box Model and Flexbox Practice Tasks

!! While performing these tasks, it's advisable to use tools or websites that generate random colors or choose colors that are easily distinguishable to observe the effects clearly!!

## 1. Display Properties
**Task:** Create three div elements. Set the first to `display: block`, the second to `display: inline-block`, and the third to `display: inline`. Assign a unique background color to each. Observe the difference in rendering.

## 2. Padding & Margin
**Task:** Create a div with a fixed width and height. Apply padding of 20px and an external margin of 30px. Give the div a distinct background color to clearly see the effect of padding and margin.

## 3. Box-sizing Property
**Task:** Adjust the above div to ensure that its padding doesn't affect its overall dimensions by utilizing the `box-sizing` property.

## 4. Collapsing Margins
**Task:** Create two adjacent divs with distinct background colors, both with a margin-top of 15px and a margin-bottom of 15px. Notice the space between them to understand the concept of collapsing margins.

## 5. Flex Container
**Task:** Create a flex container and add five child divs inside it. Give each div a unique background color. Observe the default behavior of the flex items.

## 6. Justify-content
**Task:** Using the above flex container, space the child divs equally across the container using the `justify-content` property.

## 7. Align-items
**Task:** Adjust the height of your flex container and then vertically center the child divs using the `align-items` property.

## 8. Flex Direction
**Task:** Change the direction of the flex items from row (default) to column. Observe how the background colors are displayed in this configuration.

## 9. Flex-grow, Flex-shrink, and Flex-basis
**Task:** Give the first child div a `flex-grow` value of 2, allowing it to take up more space within the container. Also, experiment with `flex-shrink` and `flex-basis` to see their effects.

## 10. Wrapping Flex Items
**Task:** Reduce the size of the flex container and allow the child divs to wrap onto the next line when there's not enough space. Ensure each div has a distinct background color to observe the wrap behavior clearly.
